# Zoosmell-Pooplord
A mod for the unoffical homestuck collection, replaces every text instance of the beta kids names with their inital, sillier ones! This mod uses [FlaringK's Universal subsitutor](https://github.com/FlaringK/UHC-universal-substitutor), names should be replaced regardless of their case or quirk, however it won't replace names in images or flashes.

Just download the .js file and place it into your mods folder within your asset pack. Then the mod should show up in the UHC settings, where you can drag it into the active mods list.
